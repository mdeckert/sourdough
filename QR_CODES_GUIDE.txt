‚úì Bookmark http://192.168.1.50:8080/temp for quick access
‚úì Check progress anytime: sourdough status

TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

QR code doesn't work:
  ‚Üí Check phone is on WiFi (not cellular)
  ‚Üí Test in browser: http://192.168.1.50:8080/health

Temperature page won't load:
  ‚Üí Make sure server is running
  ‚Üí Check: sudo systemctl status sourdough

Wrong event logged:
  ‚Üí Can't undo via QR/web (by design for data integrity)
  ‚Üí View data file: cat data/bake_2025-10-07.jsonl
  ‚Üí Edit manually if needed (advanced)

ALTERNATIVES
================================================================================

Don't want to use QR codes? CLI still works:

  sourdough start
  sourdough log fed
  sourdough log mixed
  sourdough temp 76
  sourdough status

Or direct HTTP:
  curl -X POST http://192.168.1.50:8080/bake/start
  curl -X POST http://192.168.1.50:8080/log/temp/76
