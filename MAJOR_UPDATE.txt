MAJOR UPDATE - Multi-Day Bakes + New Features
================================================================================

Date: 2025-10-07

ISSUES FIXED
================================================================================

1. **Multi-Day Bake Support** ‚úÖ
   Problem: System created one file per calendar day, breaking overnight bakes
   Solution: Now tracks "active bakes" - bakes without bake-complete event

   How it works:
   - File names include timestamp: bake_2025-10-07_19-06.jsonl
   - System finds most recent file without bake-complete event
   - START LOAF only starts new bake if no active bake exists
   - Can log events across multiple days seamlessly

2. **"Already Started" Error** ‚úÖ
   Problem: Scanning START LOAF showed error even on first scan
   Solution: Fixed multi-day detection logic (was related to #1)

NEW FEATURES
================================================================================

1. **COMPLETE QR Code + Web UI** üìä
   - New QR code: "COMPLETE"
   - Opens beautiful mobile form for bake assessment
   - Rate: Proof level, Crumb (1-10), Browning, Score (1-10)
   - Add notes
   - Uses sliders and radio buttons for easy mobile input
   - Marks bake as complete, allowing new bake to start

2. **GET QR CODES QR Code** üìÑ
   - New QR code: "GET QR CODES"
   - Scans ‚Üí downloads the PDF directly to your phone
   - Endpoint: /qrcodes.pdf
   - Perfect for sharing or reprinting

TOTAL QR CODES: 13
================================================================================

  1. START LOAF     - Begin new bake (only if no active bake)
  2. Fed            - Feed starter

  - /log/bake-complete accepts assessment JSON
  - Fixed GET request support for all QR codes

QR Generator (internal/qr/generator.go):
  - Added "complete" QR code
  - Added "qr-pdf" QR code
  - Now generates 13 codes total

Templates (internal/server/templates.go):
  - New completePageHTML with assessment form
