     * Note logging
     * Event logging (all event types)
     * Fold count increment
     * Bake completion with assessment
     * Status endpoint
     * QR code PDF serving
     * Web UI pages
     * Method not allowed handling

2. **internal/storage/jsonl_test.go**
   - Tests storage layer functionality
   - Validates multi-day bake support
   - Tests concurrency safety
   - 11 test functions covering:
     * Storage creation
     * Event appending
     * Reading current/specific bakes
     * Active bake detection
     * Multi-day bake continuity
     * Last event retrieval
     * Bake listing
     * Completion detection
     * Assessment storage
     * Empty bake handling
     * Concurrent writes

3. **test/integration_test.sh**
   - End-to-end workflow testing
   - Tests against running server
   - Validates full bake lifecycle
   - 12 test scenarios:
     * Health check
     * Bake start (new & existing)
     * Duplicate start prevention
     * Workflow event logging
     * Temperature logging (both types)
     * Note logging
     * Fold counting
     * Bake completion with assessment
     * New bake after completion
     * Web UI page accessibility
     * Status endpoint
     * Invalid request handling

MAKEFILE TARGETS
================================================================================

make test              - Run all unit tests
make test-coverage     - Run tests with HTML coverage report
make test-integration  - Run integration tests (requires server running)
make test-all          - Run both unit and integration tests

RUNNING TESTS
================================================================================

Unit Tests:
  $ make test

  Output:
  ✓ 22 unit tests across 2 packages
  ✓ All handlers tested
  ✓ All storage functions tested
  ✓ ~30ms execution time

Coverage Report:
  $ make test-coverage

  Generates:
  - coverage.out (raw data)
  - coverage.html (visual report)

Integration Tests:
  $ make test-integration

  Requirements:
  - Server must be running on port 8080
  - Tests full workflow end-to-end

  Output:
  ✓ 24 integration tests
  ✓ Color-coded output (green/red)
  ✓ Summary with pass/fail counts

All Tests:
  $ make test-all

  Runs unit tests followed by integration tests

Example CI Workflow:
  1. Build: make build
  2. Unit Tests: make test
  3. Start Server: ./bin/sourdough-server &
  4. Integration Tests: make test-integration
  5. Coverage: make test-coverage

BENEFITS
